# ts2w
tool that allows you to write typescript and then packs it for web usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxfandudeguy/ts2w.git
cd ts2w
```
edit `src/index.ts` in order to get a different output

once you are done editing run `npm run build`

it should generate a `bundle.js` in the `dist` directory
